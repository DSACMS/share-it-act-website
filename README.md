# {name_of_project_here} 
<!-- This should be 1-3 sentence short description of the project that can be used as a 'one-liner' to describe the repo. A best practice is using this same language as the official 'description' on a GitHub repo landing page. --> 
 
 ## About the Project 
<!-- This should be a longer-form description of the project. It can include history, background, details, problem statements, links to design documents or other supporting materials, or any other information/context that a user or contributor might be interested in. --> 
 
 ## Project Vision 
<!-- Provide the long-term goals and aspirations for this project. --> 
 
 ## Project Mission 
<!-- Provide the core mission and objectives driving this project. --> 
 
 ## Agency Mission 
<!-- Provide the mission of the agency and how this project aligns. --> 
 
 ## Team Mission 
<!-- Provide the team's mission and how they work together. --> 
 
 ## Core Team 
An up-to-date list of core team members can be found in [COMMUNITY.md](COMMUNITY.md). At this time, the project is still building the core team and defining roles and responsibilities. We are eagerly seeking individuals who would like to join the community and help us define and fill these roles. 
 
 ## Documentation Index 
<!-- TODO: This is a like a 'table of contents' for your documentation. Tier 0/1 projects with simple README.md files without many sections may or may not need this, but it is still extremely helpful to provide 'bookmark' or 'anchor' links to specific sections of your file to be referenced in tickets, docs, or other communication channels. --> 
 **{list of .md at top directory and descriptions}** 
 
 ## Repository Structure 
<!-- TODO: Using the 'tree -d' command can be a helpful way to generate this information, but, be sure to update it as the project evolves and changes over time. --> 
 <!--TREE START--><!--TREE END-->

 ## Local Development 
<!--- TODO - with example below: 
This project is monorepo with several apps. Please see the [api](./api/README.md) and [frontend](./frontend/README.md) READMEs for information on spinning up those projects locally. Also see the project [documentation](./documentation) for more info. --> 
 
 ## Coding Style and Linters 
<!-- TODO - Add the repo's linting and code style guidelines --> 
 Each application has its own linting and testing guidelines. Lint and code tests are run on each commit, so linters and tests should be run locally before commiting. 
 
 ## Branching Model 
 <!-- TODO - with example below:
 This project follows [trunk-based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/), which means:

* Make small changes in [short-lived feature branches](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/short-lived-feature-branches/) and merge to `main` frequently.
* Be open to submitting multiple small pull requests for a single ticket (i.e. reference the same ticket across multiple pull requests).
* Treat each change you merge to `main` as immediately deployable to production. Do not merge changes that depend on subsequent changes you plan to make, even if you plan to make those changes shortly.
* Ticket any unfinished or partially finished work.
* Tests should be written for changes introduced, and adhere to the text percentage threshold determined by the project.

This project uses **continuous deployment** using [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) which is configured in the [./github/workflows](.github/workflows) directory.

Pull-requests are merged to `main` and the changes are immediately deployed to the development environment. Releases are created to push changes to production.--> 
 
 ## Community 
The {name_of_project_here} team is taking a community-first and open source approach to the product development of this tool. We believe government software should be made in the open and be built and licensed such that anyone can download the code, run it themselves without paying money to third parties or using proprietary software, and use it as they will.

We know that we can learn from a wide variety of communities, including those who will use or will be impacted by the tool, who are experts in technology, or who have experience with similar technologies deployed in other spaces. We are dedicated to creating forums for continuous conversation and feedback to help shape the design and development of the tool.

We also recognize capacity building as a key part of involving a diverse open source community. We are doing our best to use accessible language, provide technical and process documents, and offer support to community members with a wide variety of backgrounds and skillsets. 
 
 ## Community Guidelines 
Principles and guidelines for participating in our open source community are can be found in [COMMUNITY_GUIDELINES.md](COMMUNITY_GUIDELINES.md). Please read them before joining or starting a conversation in this repo or one of the channels listed below. All community members and participants are expected to adhere to the community guidelines and code of conduct when participating in community spaces including: code repositories, communication channels and venues, and events.
